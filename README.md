# Dart Deferred Loading Example
A simple example of deferred loading in Dart. To build and run the example, do the following:

```
pub get
pub serve
```

Then you can load the example in your favorite browser `http://localhost:8080`. Click the button labeled "Load". It will then deferred load a library which, when it is loaded, will display a "hello" message.
